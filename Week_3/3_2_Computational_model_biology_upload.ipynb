Think back to calculus and Riemann's sums, and how the iterval affects the accuracy of your estimation. \n",

So far, we've kept our dt equal to 1 in our simulations, which helps keep things neat for how we set up our for loop and the index that it will iterate through. But is this accurate?When setting up simulations, you need to consider the effect of your step size on your simulation because like how the interval size for a Riemann's sum affects how accurately it estimates a continuous interval, your step size will also affect your model's ability to simulate real-world processes.\n",

    "Generally, you don't want a step that is too small, which can slow down your simulations because you are performing too many calculations that don't really reduce the error of your model in a meaningful way, and you don't want a step size that is too large, which could lead to undersampling. And a helpful rule of thumb is to keep halving your dt until your simulation estimatations remain roughly the same, within some acceptable error."
