    "Yesterday, we aligned our RNA-seq reads to a reference genome using the splice aware aligner HISAT2, and today, we'll be counting our mapped reads in order to set up for differential expression analysis. To do this, we'll make use of a program called HTSeq, which will allow us to count the reads mapped to different genomic features, and in the case of RNA-seq, we're interested in counting reads that have mapped to exons. Each group will then obtain raw counts for their control and TAZ KO replicates. We'll take a look at the data in our Python notebooks to do some basic QC, and then take a look to see if we might have some potentially differentially expressed genes just solely based on one replicate.\n",
